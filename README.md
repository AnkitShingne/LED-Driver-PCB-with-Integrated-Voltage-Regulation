# LED Driver PCB with Integrated Voltage Regulation

## Overview
This repository contains the files and documentation for a PCB design project created using Eagle PCB design software. The project focuses on designing an LED driver circuit with integrated voltage regulation.

## Files Included
* __'project.sch'__: Eagle schematic file containing the LED driver circuit design.
*  __'project.brd'__: Eagle board layout file with components placed and routed.
* __'gerber_files'__: Folder containing Gerber files for manufacturing the PCB.
* __'README.md'__: This readme file providing project information and instructions.

## Project Details
The LED driver PCB is designed to regulate voltage and ensure consistent LED illumination while managing input voltage fluctuations. The schematic and board layout files are included for reference and modification.

## Usage
1. Open __'project.sch'__ in Eagle to view the schematic design.
2. Open __'project.brd'__ in Eagle to view the board layout.
3. The __'gerber_files/'__ folder contains Gerber files required for manufacturing the PCB.
